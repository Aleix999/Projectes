# Asteroids

This repo is for the Asteroids project from Coding Challenge 45.

### Info

The code here is an updated and improved version of the game based on viewer submissions via pull requests.  The original code from the challenge itself can be found here:


To submit a new issue, [file an issue describing your idea](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Asteroids/issues/new) and [make a pull request](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Asteroids/pulls)! If you make your own version of the game in a separate repo or fork, pull request this README file to add a link.

I'll make a video about how to contribute soon too!
